# Token-Free Modeling for Hinglish NLP

## Abstract
This repository studies robustness in Hinglish (Hindi-English code-mixed) text classification under realistic noise. We compare one token-based baseline (mBERT) with token-free alternatives (CANINE-S and ByT5-small) across clean and noisy test conditions. The core objective is to quantify robustness degradation due to typos, casing shifts, emoji insertion, and transliteration variation.

## Research Question
How much robustness do token-free models retain under noisy Hinglish compared with subword tokenization baselines?

## Model Family Comparison
- mBERT: subword tokenization baseline
- CANINE-S: character-level token-free model
- ByT5-small: byte-level token-free model

## Key Results
Final Noise Robustness Index (NRI):

| Model | Clean Acc | Noisy Acc | NRI (%) |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| mBERT | 95.7% | 1.49% | **1.56%** |
| CANINE-S | 93.7% | 52.9% | **56.4%** |
| ByT5-small | 29.7% | 27.3% | **91.9%** |

Interpretation:
- mBERT achieves high clean accuracy but collapses under noise.
- CANINE-S preserves substantially better robustness.
- ByT5-small has the strongest relative robustness retention (highest NRI).

## Method Summary
1. Build validated clean train/validation/test splits from human-annotated data.
2. Generate multiple noisy variants with humanlike perturbations.
3. Train three architectures independently.
4. Evaluate each model on clean and noisy partitions.
5. Compute model-wise metrics and NRI.
6. Generate visual comparisons and robustness charts.

## Artifact Availability
To keep the repository lightweight and GitHub-compatible, large artifacts are not versioned in this public snapshot:
- data/
- models/
- results/

These can be shared separately (for example, cloud storage, Hugging Face, or Zenodo) in a camera-ready update.
